## :bulb: What is Design System?
A single source of the truth for the designers, developers, and the products.

## :bulb: Why you do need a Design System?
Design system is not a new thing. These are here from decades, thanks to our very complex UI and UX as well as rapidly changing technology.
Companies are moving towards the Design System to also make sure that :

:point_right: Brand guidelines of the organization is followed by every product and project of the organization.

:point_right: Code Guidelines of the organization should be followed by every product and project within the organization.

:point_right: Designers and engineers can focus on more important and creative work rahter than just doing same task again.

:point_right: Remove the redundant tasks.

## :bulb: How to start?
This is the most important question for everyone who is new to design system. If you Google Design System guide - the result you will get is what design system is, what it has etc. but no one explains - "How to start a design system" from a UX, UI, product Lead , or tester presepctive.Here is the process which I have followed and you can follow too:

__For Developers: "Do not start with the code."__
__For Designers: "Do not start with the design."__

Most important task is to understand clearly about the scope of the design system, problems you are trying to solve by Design System, requirements of the organiztion/product/projects.
